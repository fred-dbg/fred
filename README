To set this up, you'll want to do several things.

1.  Configure a copy of DMTCP as:  ./configure --with-record-replay
    Then compile as usual:  make  [ or maybe:  "make -j3" if you have 2 cores ]

2.  ( cd record-replay; ./configure --with-dmtcp-root=DMTCP_ROOT )
      where DMTCP_ROOT is the root directory of DMTCP that you configured above

3.  ( cd record-replay; make )

4.  Read setup.sh and modify DMTCP_ROOT and DMTCP_PORT

5.  . ./setup.sh

6.  You can now try it out with the suggestion of setup.sh:
      ./fredapp.py --fred-demo gdb test/test-list
    My own favorite sequence of commands is:
    (gdb) break main
    (gdb) run
    (gdb) fred-ckpt
    (gdb) break 30
    (gdb) continue
    (gdb) fred-reverse-watch list_len(head)<17
    (gdb) where
    (gdb) list
    (gdb) next
    (gdb) fred-reverse-step
    (gdb) where
    (gdb) fred-reverse-next
    (gdb) where
